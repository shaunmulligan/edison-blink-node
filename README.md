# edison-blink-node

A simple node.js project to get you started with the [Intel Edison][edison-link] and [Resin.io][resin-link].
This project uses the [MRAA][mraa-repo] library to toggle the onboard led (GPIO 13) of the Intel Edison arduino base board on and off.


To get this project running on your intel edison, first checkout the ["Getting Started with Intel Edison"][getting-started page in the docs..

If you already have a resin.io account:
* Create a new Intel Edison project 
* add/provision as many edisons as you want to the app, if you need help doing this check [here][provision-an-edison].
* Clone this repo to your development computer and add your you resin.io applications endpoint, it should look something like `git@git.resin.io:shaunrmulligan/myedison.git`
* Now run `git push resin master` from the newly cloned project.
* After the code has compiled and been downloaded by the device(s), you should have some leds happily blinking away.

Enjoy!!
